# ErrorPrinter
This is a fun ~~little~~¹ project born out of boredom during one of my programming lectures. The basic concept is that any error generated by your code is printed on paper giveing a new meaning to "print debugging". Get your text markers ready and start coding.

## JetBrains Plugin
Find the plugin [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17483-real-error-printer) or by searching in your JetBrain IDEs plugin section. We are adding some new features and maintaining it a least somewhat.

## A bit more Information. But not too much.
The original concept was implemented in a short amount of time as basic java code. You had too modify the code too use your own printer and have it in the project at all times.
The new and improved™ concept is a fully implemented JetBrains Plugin for all different sorts of languages. With a settings panel to turn it off.²

## Additional Notes
Use only if you have too much ink and paper. Well you could also just select the PDF-printer but that is boring.
