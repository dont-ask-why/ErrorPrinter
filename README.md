# ErrorPrinter
This is a fun ~~little~~[^1] project born out of boredom during one of my programming lectures. The basic concept is that any error generated by your code is printed on paper and not in the console. This gives a new meaning to "print debugging". Get your text markers reading and start coding.

## A bit more Information. But not too much.
The original concept was implemented in a short amount of time as basic java code. You had too modify the code too use your own printer and have it in the project at all times.
The new and improvedâ„¢ conecpt is a fully implemented JetBrains Plugin for all different sorts of languages. With a settings panel to turn it off [^2]. At least that is the plan and currently under development.

## Additional Notes
Use only if you have too much ink and paper. Well you could also just select the PDF-printer but that is boring.
